A project where I predict the 2021 winner of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series.

Question: Will the show with the highest number of jokes per minute win the Primetime Emmy Award for Best Outstanding Comedy Series?
In other words, is the show with the highest frequency of jokes be considered the "funniest"?

I have watched the first episode of each show's nominated season and noted each joke made as well as the type of joke it is. The reason why I chose the first episode instead of taking the average of jokes per every episode in a season is because all shows did not have an equal amount of episodes, ex. Ted Lasso's nominated season had 8 episodes while Black-ish had 22.

Below is a brief explanation of the 4 categories used to organize the type of jokes made:

ONE one-liner
SET set up
VIS visual
RPJ reference to a previous joke made in the episode
REF reference to outside media
